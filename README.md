In this project,the aim is to use some of the api's from Flickr in order to retrieve a users's photos (searched based on id).
For Flickr's sensitive data i've used the 'Figaro' gem file in order to protect the confidential data.
The photos's size is calculated by an api (also from Flickr) that doesn't distort the photos but reduces them to the perfect size for convenience purposes.
